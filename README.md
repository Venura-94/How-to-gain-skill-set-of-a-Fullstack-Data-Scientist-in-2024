# Step 1 â€“ Python Basics

To kickstart my journey, I delved into the fundamentals of Python programming, drawing inspiration from David J. Malan's [CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50P+Python/home) course on edX.

## Course Details:
- **Course Title**: CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python
- **Platform**: [edX](https://www.edx.org/)

## Course Content:
Throughout the course, I covered a wide array of Python basics, including:
- Variables and Data Types
- Control Structures (Loops and Conditionals)
- Functions and Modules
- Input and Output Handling
- Data Structures (Lists, Dictionaries, etc.)

## Practice Opportunities:
The course provided engaging problem sets and assignments, offering ample opportunities to apply the concepts learned and hone my skills. With each practice session, I aimed to solidify my understanding and build a strong foundation in Python programming.
